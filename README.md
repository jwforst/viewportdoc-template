# Viewportdoc Editor Template

The Viewportdoc Editor template is an HTML wrapper for containing open-source editors. It is part of a web-app-based system that provides the means to create documentation integrated into pre-built templates for publishing as a webpage or publishing as a locally stored stand-alone package that can be viewed with an associated viewer application. This repository is part of a project that is currently under development. The rest of this project is contained in private repositories that will be made public at a later time.
